# Bar Chart Versus Column Chart

Bar charts are useful for displaying data that are classified into nominal or ordinal categories.
With nominal data, arranging the categories so that the bars grade sequentially from the largest category to the smallest category helps the reader to interpret the data. However, this is not appropriate for ordinal data because the categories already have an obvious sequence

Stacked bar charts can also be used to show the percentage contribution different sub-groups contribute to each separate category

Bar charts are good for displaying long data labels and large number of data sets on the category axis.

Column charts are good for displaying data that include categories with negative values, because it is possible to position the bars below and above the x-axis.

# Grouped Bar Chart Versus Stacked Bar Chart

Grouped bar charts are good for comparing between each element in the categories, and comparing elements across categories.  
Stacked bar charts are good for showing difference between the total of each group though, but it becomes harder to compare the sizes of the individual categories in a group.
